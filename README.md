# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

This is a portfolio for Data Science and Machine Learning.
The goal is to analyze the Kaggle Titanic dataset and experiment with multiple Machine Learning Models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost to generate the most accurate prediction regarding the survivors of the disaster.

## Project Structure

- `data/raw/` - original CSV files from Kaggle
- `data/processed/` - preprocessed data ready for modeling
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration and visualization
- `reports/figures/` - generated plots and visualizations
- `src/` - Python code for preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation

## Next Steps

1. [] Data preprocessing
2. [] Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization
3. [] Model building and experimentation
4. [] Evaluation and comparison of model performance
5. [] Feature engineering and fine-tune the model
